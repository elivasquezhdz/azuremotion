# azuremotion
Submission to Azure AI Hackathon


This is my submission to: https://azureai.devpost.com/

Instructions to run:

Clone or download repo:

Install dependencies (kivy, opencv)

Extract the images zip

Change the api key in line 63

Run: azuremotion.py

What it does:

It shows you one of the four cateogries of memes: [Dank,Edgy,Wholesemo,Normie]

In order to capture your emotional response and write a log file to then (in the future implement this) learn what are the best memes for making people happy :D


The log file: emotions.log will be written with the emotions detected from the user watching the screen

Enjoy!
